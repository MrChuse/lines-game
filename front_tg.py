This is similar to turn-based football on a grid.
Grid consists of _vertices_ and _edges_ which connect them.
At the start of the game the ball is located in the center of the field.
Objective of the the game is to score a goal by moving the ball to your opponent's _goal vertex_.
On their turn, a player must move the ball to the adjacent vertex, so there are 8 possible moves.
However, when the ball passes an _already visited vertex_, the player must make an _additional move_, giving him an opportunity to send the ball closer to their opponent's goal vertex.
Also, the ball leaves a trace and making a move which is a part of a trace is illegal. Crossing the trace is ok though.
